# MicroPython on the micro:bit Workshop

## What?

This repository contains Markdown based resources - each of which being a
self-contained educational activity for using and learning about MicroPython on
the micro:bit. In the future they may even be categorised in terms of learning
level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).

## How?

In the first instance, these activities will be written with Markdown. We hope
to make them available in various media (web, PDF, epub) so they can be useful
for school lessons and community workshops.

The individual resources are organised by language code. For example, English
versions of the resources can be found in the directory called "en".

## Why?

Because we believe community derived educational resources that, together, form
a complete curriculum for MicroPython on the micro:bit are important. There are
three reasons why:

* Teachers and developers with experience of delivering workshops with MicroPython on the micro:bit have a way to contribute back to the community. (Send us a PR!).

* It's a useful body of work, knowledge and opportunity to have freely available to the wider community.

* It's important to encourage empowerment in the digital world.
